Issue Summary:

The company website was unavailable for approximately 45 minutes due to an issue with the Nginx web server configuration. Users attempting to access the website encountered a "Connection refused" error. This outage impacted 100% of website visitors during the timeframe.

Timeline:

    10:00 AM PST: Monitoring alerts notified the operations team of a significant drop in website traffic.
    10:05 AM PST: An engineer investigated the issue and confirmed the website was unreachable.
    10:05 AM - 10:20 AM PST: Initial investigation focused on potential server overload due to a recent marketing campaign. Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory) on the server were reviewed but showed normal levels.
    10:20 AM PST: The investigation shifted towards Nginx configuration. The engineer reviewed the Nginx configuration file and identified an error in the "listen" directive.
    10:25 AM PST: The operations team was escalated to assist with resolving the configuration issue.
    10:30 AM PST: The incorrect "listen" directive was corrected to bind Nginx to all server interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 80.
    10:35 AM PST: The Nginx service was restarted to apply the configuration changes.
    10:40 AM PST: Website functionality was restored, and monitoring confirmed normal service.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was an incorrect configuration in the Nginx server block. The "listen" directive, which specifies the IP address and port on which Nginx listens for incoming connections, was misconfigured. This resulted in Nginx failing to bind to port 80 on any interface, effectively making the website inaccessible.

The issue was resolved by correcting the "listen" directive in the Nginx configuration file. The configuration was changed to listen on all server interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 80, ensuring Nginx accepts connections from any IP address. Following the configuration change, the Nginx service was restarted to reload the updated settings.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improve Nginx configuration review process: Implement a code review process for all Nginx configuration changes to minimize the risk of errors.
    Enhance infrastructure monitoring: Include checks for Nginx configuration validity and active listening ports as part of the server monitoring suite. This would provide faster detection of similar issues in the future.
    Automate configuration management: Utilize configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet to automate Nginx configuration deployment. This can help enforce consistency and reduce the chance of manual errors.
